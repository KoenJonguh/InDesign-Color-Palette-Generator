A script for InDesign that creates a nice color palette for you.

Create a square (Or other shape) and fill it with some color. Select the square, run the script, BAM, small color palette.
For some reason it doesn't work with some colors, i don't know how to fix that. But it mostly works well.
Add a shortcut to this script to use it super fast.
