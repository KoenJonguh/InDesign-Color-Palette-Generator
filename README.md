A script for InDesign that creates a nice colorpalette for you.

Create a quare and fill it with some color. Select the square, run the script, BAM, colorpalette.
For some reason it doesn't work with some colors, i don't know how to fix that. But it mostly works well.
Add a shortcut to this script to use it super fast.
